Fungus 3D Template
==================
This is a template for building Fungus narratives inside of an interactive 3D environment. This template proposes a point-and-click style interaction wherein a central caracter navigates to a point X via click/touch; when this central caracter approaches another character, a Fungus dialog is started, using the dialog UI of each chracter for their dialogue.
